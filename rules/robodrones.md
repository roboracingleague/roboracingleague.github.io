## Racing rules

* Drones maximum motor to motor size is 300mm 
* Drones must pass thru the gates in the right order and in the right direction
* Drones touching gates will be penalized 10s for every gate touched on lap time
* Drones must be equipped with propeller protections
* Drones must be totally autonomous
* All cameras are allowed, even those with laser illumination. Be aware that illumination could be forbidden in future races
* Distance sensors using ultrasound, IR or laser are allowed (1D sensors)
* LIDAR devices providing 2D or 3D data are NOT allowed 

## Race results, points & standings 

* Race result points are attributed following race finish order from 1st to 10th  
25 - 18 - 15 - 12 - 10 - 8 - 6 – 4 – 2 – 1
* Drones must succeed at a race to get the race points.  
For example, in a Sprint Race a car not achieving 2 laps will not get points even if it is the best performance
* Race result points are ajusted through the difficulty factor of each race  
10 pts (5th place) in a Sprint will count
10 x 1 = 10 pts for the championship
* Race result points will count for the championship only if at least 2 drones succeed at the race
* All championship points for every race will be added at the end of the season to determine the winner of the season
